# 🚀 Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

## 📌 About This Project
Hi everyone! This is my university project for the **Principles of Operating Systems** course. It is a simple **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** that monitors your system for suspicious activities.

## 🔍 How It Works
- When you run the Python script, a **GUI** will open.
- Click the **"Start Monitoring"** button to begin real-time system monitoring.
- The program scans your system **every 2 seconds** for:
  - **High CPU or RAM usage**
  - **Suspicious processes** (like malware or keyloggers)
  - **Unusual open ports**
- If any threat is detected, the program logs an **alert** for the user.

## 🛠 Testing the IDS
You can test this IDS using the **"attack simulation"** directory, which contains example scripts to simulate suspicious activities.

⚠ **Warning:** If your system has a **low-performance CPU or RAM**, be careful when running simulations, as they may cause high resource usage.
