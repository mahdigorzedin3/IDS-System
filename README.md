Intrusion Detection System (IDS) 🚀
About This Project
Hi everyone! This is my university project for the Principles of Operating Systems course. It is a simple Intrusion Detection System (IDS) that monitors your system for suspicious activities.

How It Works
When you run the Python script, a GUI will open.

Click the "Start Monitoring" button to begin real-time system monitoring.

The program scans your system every 2 seconds for:

High CPU or RAM usage

Suspicious processes (like malware or keyloggers)

Unusual open ports

If any threat is detected, the program logs an alert for the user.

Testing the IDS
You can test this IDS using the "attack simulation" directory, which contains example scripts to simulate suspicious activities.

⚠ Warning: If your system has a low-performance CPU or RAM, be careful when running simulations, as they may cause high resource usage.

Enjoy & Stay Secure! 🔐
This version is clear, structured, and professional while keeping your original intent. Let me know if you want any tweaks! 🚀
